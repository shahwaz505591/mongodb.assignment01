    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans:MongoDB is a popular non-relational database management system that is designed to store and manage unstructured and semi-structured data. It uses a document-oriented data model, which means that it stores data in JSON-like documents that can have varying structures and do not require a fixed schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a class of databases that do not use the traditional relational model used by SQL databases. Instead, they use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, which can be challenging to manage using traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several scenarios in which MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases. One of the most common use cases for MongoDB is for applications that require high scalability and availability, such as web and mobile applications. MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means that it can easily distribute data across multiple servers, making it easy to handle large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of MongoDB is its flexibility and ease of use. Since it does not require a fixed schema, it can handle data that is constantly changing or evolving, which is common in applications that use agile development methodologies. Additionally, MongoDB supports a wide range of programming languages and has a large and active community that provides support and resources.\n",

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that offers a range of features to help manage and store large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data in a document-oriented data model, which means that it stores data as JSON-like documents that can have varying structures. This allows for a high level of flexibility and scalability when it comes to data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Dynamic schema: MongoDB does not require a fixed schema, which means that data can be added or modified without affecting the structure of the database. This allows for a high level of flexibility when it comes to data modeling and handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.High performance: MongoDB is designed to handle high volumes of data and can support large-scale applications with high traffic volumes. It uses a range of features to optimize query performance, such as indexing, sharding, and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Horizontal scaling: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, which means that it can distribute data across multiple servers to improve performance and increase capacity. This makes it easy to handle large volumes of data and support high levels of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Rich query language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that allows for complex queries and data analysis. It supports a range of query operations, such as aggregation, filtering, and sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Replication and high availability: MongoDB provides features for data replication and high availability, which means that data is automatically copied and distributed across multiple servers. This ensures that data is always available, even in the event of a server failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Security: MongoDB provides a range of security features to protect data, such as encryption, access controls, and auditing. This ensures that data is secure and protected from unauthorized access.\n",
